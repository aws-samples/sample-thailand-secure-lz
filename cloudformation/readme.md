## Prerequisites:
Complete these validation checks before starting the deployment of the SLZ. 
1. Have your AWS management account ready. If not can create by this link https://aws.amazon.com/resources/create-account/
2. Login with the user that has an Administrator access
3. Create and AWS organization in management account. Go to AWS Organizaion , Click “Create an organization”. Write down the Orgainzaion ID (o-xxx) Under Organization > Settings, We will use in the other step of installation.
4. Prepare an email for create 2 new accounts
5. From the AWS organization create a  new account name “Shared Service” . This account will use for backup administration, administration delegation and other common cloud operation actions. This account will be required during Control Tower Backup setup.
6. Create a new account name “Central Backup”. This account will use for the central storage of backups. This account will be required during Control Tower Backup setup.
7. **AWS environment does not have any running workloads and services.**
8. All deny Service Control Policies (SCPs) and Resource Control Policies (RCPs) are detached from OUs. ( AWS Organizations > Policies)
9. Prepare separate emails for log-archive and audit accounts that will be created when Control Tower is initiated.
10. Disable existing AWS security services (AWS Security Hub, Config, Amazon GuardDuty, Detective, Amazon Inspector) across all the regions. Remove delegated administration setting for each of the services.

## Troubleshooting
1. AWS CloudFormation deployment issues
- Go to AWS CloudFormation console, and select the Stack that has identified issues.
- Review the "Events" tab, and click on "View root cause" to identify the specific action that caused the failed deployment.
- Review the Lambda function's CloudWatch log group events to determine what may have caused the issues. Go to "Resources" tab and select the LambdaLogGroup to review the log stream events and to identify the potential root causes.

2. AWS CloudFormation rollback failure
- Go to AWS CloudFormation console and select the Stack with the identified issues. 
- Force delete the StackSet and check the box to delete resources.
- Go to resources and check that all the previously created resources (e.g. IAM Role, Lamdba Function, Amazon CloudWatch Log Group) are moved. Click on each remaining resource, and delete the remaining resource manually. 

3. AWS CloudFormation StackSet deployment failures
- After rolling back (deleting) a StackSet, there may be some remaining CloudWatch Log Groups that were not removed. Go to the affected account and region to delete remaining CloudWatch Log Groups built by the StackSet before attempting to re-run the StackSet.

4. Control Tower Backup enrollment failure
- Error description "Insufficient privileges to create a backup vault. Creating a backup vault requires backup-storage and KMS permissions."
- Review the KMS Key used for Control Tower Backup, to ensure that the region key replication is the same as Control Tower governed regions.

5. When deploy lz-delegate-firewall-manager-ipam.yaml on the Deployment step 15 if you got an error please delete the stack and re-deploy
