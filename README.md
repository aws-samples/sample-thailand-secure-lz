# Secure Landing Zone (SLZ) for Thailand Public Sector

The Secure Landing Zone (SLZ) provides a secure cloud foundation for Thai government ministries, agencies, and authorized partners deploying AWS multi-account environments. Built to align with Thailand National Cyber Security Agency (NCSA) requirements, the solution uses Infrastructure as Code (IaC) scripts to automate security guardrails implementation. This streamlined approach allows organizations to rapidly establish a compliant AWS environment while maintaining security best practices from day one.
